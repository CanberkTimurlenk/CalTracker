## Features

CalTracker has the ability to store calorie and nutritional data for the meals of its users. Users can specify their meals and meal times from the menu, and the software calculates the nutritional content, presenting information about calories, fat, and protein for the chosen food and meal. Statistics for both weekly and monthly views are conveniently accessible from the main menu. User registration is a mandatory and email confirmation is required.

## Software

While a Windows Form Application was used for presentation purposes to showcase the software's capabilities, the top layer of the project can be easily replaced with an MVC or Web API project, thanks to its flexible structure and the proper implementation of the open-closed principle.

The software essentially provides a calorie tracking module. Additionally, a water consumption tracker and various other modules, such as recipe collections, could also be easily integrated, thanks to followed best practices.

In adherence to the Solid principles, it was developed with the n-tier architecture. Customized exceptions have also been included to allow using of different projects at the top layer. There is a constants folder which is designed to centralize configurations and prevent the occurrence of magic string issues.
